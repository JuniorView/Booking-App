<h2> Welcome to my modest Campus Project! </h2>
This is a Booking Application featuring a basic user interface, developed in C++.
While the UI may lack aesthetic appeal for customers, the app incorporates several functional capabilities. 
You can explore features such as reading booking data in <strong>JSON </strong>format, searching for customers, adding new bookings, displaying the location of a booking on a map, and more.
Although the application is still a work in progress, it has been an exciting and rewarding endeavor. Enjoy!
